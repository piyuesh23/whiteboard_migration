# Pre-requisites:
  - Create a directory 'invoice_files' under 'Whiteboard' root folder. Make sure this directory is writable by the user running your webserver.
  - Create a new bucket with name 'whiteboarddev'. This could be created on the fly as well, but since this is a one time process, its hardcoded @whiteboard_migration.moduleL#303.
  - Create ~/.aws/credentials & write aws credentials in the credentials file. This is to keep your aws details secure.
    - Tempalate:
      [default]
      aws_access_key_id = [AWS_KEY]
      aws_secret_access_key = [AWS_ACCESS_KEY]

# Installation:
  - drush en -y whiteboard_migration
NOTE: This module contains code for theme pre-processors as well, so should be enabled for the sites whose template files have been modified. List of sites for which the module should be enabled:
  - http://whiteboard.cactusglobal.com
  - http://payments.cactusglobal.com
  - http://wiki.editage.com
  - http://online.editage.jp

# What this module provides:
  - Theme pre-processor functions where the db_query is moved to from tpl files.
  - drush commands to handle the migration
    - drush mwig: generates html files from content in content_type_invoice table & store them in invoice_files folder.
    - drush mwiu: uploads the html files from invoice_files directory to s3 bucket 'whiteboarddev'.
    - drush mwpg: generates html files for the payments content corresponding to migrated invoices.
    - drush mwpu: uploads the html files from invoice_files directory to s3 bucket 'whiteboarddev'.

NOTE: Please make sure the order of execution matters here.

# Post-processing:
  - After running the drush commands, make sure we delete the invoice_files folder. This will be an exact duplicate of the html files uploaded to s3.
